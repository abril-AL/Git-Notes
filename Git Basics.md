- Getting a Repository
	- 2 main ways - turn local directory into a git repository or `clone` an existing repository 
- initializing existing directory
	- first cd to that directory
	- do: `git init`
	- nothing is tracked at that point, but everything after will be
- cloning existing
	- `git clone consolehttps://github.com/link-to-repo`
	- name it something else
		- `git clone https://github.com/cloning myName
- can use some other transfer protocols ( `git://` or ssh )

## Recording Changes
- tracked files - files in the last snapshot, git knows about them
- untracked files -any files in working directory not in staging area

- Checking status
	- `git status`
	- can determine state of files
	- lists untracked files, new files, modified files, etc
- Tracking new files
	- will be listed as `new file:`
	- will be in next commit
- Staging Modified Files
	- will be listed as `modified:`
	- can list a tracked file, and list modified as unstaged, stages only how the file looked when it was added, modified version of the file will be listed as unstaged
- Short Status
	- `git status -s`
	- simplified version of status cmd
	- `??` means untracked , `A` means added to staging area , `M` means modified
- Ignoring Files
	- files we dont want git to add automatically or list as untracked
	- can tell git to ignore files with a listing pattern
		- ex `*.[oa]*` means ignore `.o` or `.a` files
		- glob patterns
- Viewing staged and unstaged changes
	- `git diff` shows exact lines added and removed
	- `git diff --staged` - compared your staged changes to your last commit
- Commiting Changes
	- `git commit`
	- commits all staged files
	- `git commit -m "text describing commit"`
- Skipping the staging area
	- `git commit -a`
	- makes git automatically stage every file that is already tracked before doing the commit
	- skip the `add` part
- Removing Files
	- have to remove it from tracked files ( from staging area )
	- `git rm` remove from tracked files *and* from working directory so you dont see it as a tracked file
	- just removing from working directory will list it as `deleted: ` in the unstaged area of `status`
	- `git rm` will stage the removal next commit will delete it
		- `-f` will force it, use if you modified or already added it tostaging area
		- safety feature to prevent accidental removal not yet recorded
	- if you want to keep the file in working tree but not in ataging area, use `cached` option
		- `got rm --cached filename`
		- can pas files, directories or globs
- Moving Files
	- renaming in git, `git mv file_from file_to
	- same as doing a `mv oldname newname`, `rm oldname` and `add newname`

## Viewing Commit History
- want to look back at history of commits ( of lclones also )
- use `git log`
	- will list in reverse chronological order 
- patch option `-p --patch`
	- shows the difference introduced in each commit
	- Displays same information with diff following each entry
- abbreviated stats, use `--stat`
	- prints a list of modified files, how many were changed, number lf lines added/removed, and a summary of the info at the end
- pretty option `--pretty=format_choice`
	- different format 
	- useful formats: `format` - get to specify, `oneline`, `graph` , 
	- `git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"` also useful
		- there are also other specifiers
- Limiting Log Output
	- can list only a subset of commits
	- ex `-2` will only list last commits, or `-<n>`
	- `-- since and --until`
		- list based on specified time 
	- filer to match criteria 
		- ex `--authorm or --grep or --all-match`
		- `-S <string>` option, lists commits that changed that string
		- can pass a directory, lists changes to files in that dir `git log -- path/to/file`

## Undoing Things
- careful, you ant always undo these changes
- Common mistakes: committed to early, forgot to add some files, mess up commit message
- `git commit --amend`
	- redo the commit
	- takes staging area and uses it for commit, if no changes were made it only changes the message
	- end up with a single commit]
- unstaging a staged file
	- `git reset HEAD file_to_unstage`
	- file is modified but once again unstaged
- unmodyfying a modified file
	- `git checkout -- file-to-unmodify`
	- removes from staging area
	- if you want to keep the changes while still removing from staging area
		- better option is branching (?)
- undoing things with git restore
	- `git restore --staged` - alternate to `git reset`
	- `git restore ` - discard changes
- `git status` will tell you the commands for these operations
- restore is a dangerous cmd, gets rid of local changes

## Working with remotes
- remote repository is a repo hosted over the internet/other network
- will push and pull from these repositories
- Showing your remotes
	- `git remote` - lists remotes (shorthands)
	- `-v` shows full URLs 
- Adding remote repositories
	- `git remote add <shortname> <url>`
- Fetching and Pulling from Your Remotes
	- `git fetch <remote>`
	- pulls the data you dont have yet, only adds to local repository
	- if you used `clone` , automaically sets up your local `master` branch to track remote `master` branch
	- `git pull` fetches from server you originally cloned from and tries to merge it into what youre currently working on
- Pushing to remotes
	- `git push <remote> <branch>` 
	- only works if u have write access and nobody has pushed in the meantime
- Inspecting a remote
	- `git remote show <remote>`
- Renaming and removing remotes
	- `git remote rename` to change remote shorthand
		- changes all remote-tracking branch names
	- `git remote remove` or `git remove rm`
		- removes all remote tracking branches and configuration

## Tagging
- tag specific points in the repo history
- listing - `git tag`, can use  matches too`git tag -l "string"`
- Creating 
	- annotated `-a` , stored as full object, contain message (`-m`), lot of other useful information
	- lightweight tags `-lw`,  basically the commit checksum stored in a file, no other information is kept, only supply a name ( no `-m -a or -s`)
- Can tag past commits after u passed them as well
- Sharing tags
	- `git push` doesnt automatically transfer tags to remote servers, run `git push origin <tagname>`
	- `git push origin --tags` push all the tags that are not already ob the remote server
- Deleting tags
	- `git checkout <tagname>` , view the versions of files a tag is pointing to

## Git Aliases
- set up alias for commands if u dont want to type them out all the way
- `git config --global alias.alias_name command_name`
	- ex `git config --global alias.ci commit`, ci instead of commit
- can also create commands that you think are useful
