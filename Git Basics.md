- Getting a Repository
	- 2 main ways - turn local directory into a git repository or `clone` an existing repository 
- initializing existing directory
	- first cd to that directory
	- do: `git init`
	- nothing is tracked at that point, but everything after will be
- cloning existing
	- `git clone consolehttps://github.com/link-to-repo`
	- name it something else
		- `git clone https://github.com/cloning myName
- can use some other transfer protocols ( `git://` or ssh )

## Recording Changes
- tracked files - files in the last snapshot, git knows about them
- untracked files -any files in working directory not in staging area

- Checking status
	- `git status`
	- can determine state of files
	- lists untracked files, new files, modified files, etc
- Tracking new files
	- will be listed as `new file:`
	- will be in next commit
- Staging Modified Files
	- will be listed as `modified:`
	- can list a tracked file, and list modified as unstaged, stages only how the file looked when it was added, modified version of the file will be listed as unstaged
- Short Status
	- `git status -s`
	- simplified version of status cmd
	- `??` means untracked , `A` means added to staging area , `M` means modified
- Ignoring Files
	- files we dont want git to add automatically or list as untracked
	- can tell git to ignore files with a listing pattern
		- ex `*.[oa]*` means ignore `.o` or `.a` files
		- glob patterns
- Viewing staged and unstaged changes
	- `git diff` shows exact lines added and removed
	- `git diff --staged` - compared your staged changes to your last commit
- Commiting Changes
	- `git commit`
	- commits all staged files
	- `git commit -m "text describing commit"`
- Skipping the staging area
	- `git commit -a`
	- makes git automatically stage every file that is already tracked before doing the commit
	- skip the `add` part
- Removing Files
	- have to remove it from tracked files ( from staging area )
	- `git rm` remove from tracked files *and* from working directory so you dont see it as a tracked file
	- just removing from working directory will list it as `deleted: ` in the unstaged area of `status`
	- `git rm` will stage the removal next commit will delete it
		- `-f` will force it, use if you modified or already added it tostaging area
		- safety feature to prevent accidental removal not yet recorded
	- if you want to keep the file in working tree but not in ataging area, use `cached` option
		- `got rm --cached filename`
		- can pas files, directories or globs
- Moving Files
	- renaming in git, `git mv file_from file_to
	- same as doing a `mv oldname newname`, `rm oldname` and `add newname`
